# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the Earthquake Dashboard header by removing the hero/banner and add a full-screen toggle control to the Leaflet map.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the hero/banner section visuals (background image/gradient, badge, description text) and keep only the title “Global Earthquake Activity” as a plain heading above the filters/controls.
- Add a Leaflet full-screen toggle button directly below the existing zoom controls that expands the map into a full-screen overlay and toggles back to the prior layout (including in Map View and Split View), with accessible labeling.

**User-visible outcome:** The dashboard shows a simple title header (no banner), and users can toggle the map into and out of full-screen via a control button beneath the zoom controls.
