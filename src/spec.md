# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a secondary subtitle line under the existing hero title on the Earthquake Dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/pages/EarthquakeDashboard.tsx` to render a centered H2 subtitle directly below the existing hero title.
- Style the subtitle to be visually secondary (e.g., smaller and/or muted) while keeping the hero title text, alignment, and layout unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The dashboard hero displays the existing main title plus a new centered subtitle reading “Latest real-time earthquake information around the world” immediately beneath it.
