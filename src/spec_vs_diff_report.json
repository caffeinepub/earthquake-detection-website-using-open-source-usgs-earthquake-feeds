  "summary": "The diff clearly improves the Results table’s narrow-width behavior by containing horizontal overflow inside the table region and preserving sticky headers/virtualized scrolling structure. However, Split view responsiveness (REQ-34) appears to rely on hard-coded height breakpoints per the provided file summary, which conflicts with the requirement to avoid fixed heights that can clip content on short viewports. Additionally, the map component includes new bounds-based marker filtering/debouncing behavior that was not requested.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-34",
      "requirement": "No fixed hard-coded Split view container height forces content to be inaccessible on short viewports; the layout adapts to viewport height using responsive CSS sizing.",
      "reason": "The diff evidence indicates Split view uses hard-coded height values by breakpoint (e.g., 400/500/600/700), which does not demonstrate adapting to viewport height and risks clipping on short viewports.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (EarthquakeDashboard.tsx summary mentions: \"adaptive heights (400px on mobile, 500px on small screens, 600px on large, 700px on xl)\")"
