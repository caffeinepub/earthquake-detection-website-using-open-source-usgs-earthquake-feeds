  "summary": "The diff appears to address the table cropping issue by making EarthquakeResultsTable support a parent-constrained “fill height” layout (flex + min-h-0 + overflow-auto) while preserving the existing virtualized rendering, which should prevent bottom clipping in both Table and Split views. No edits to shadcn/ui source files are shown in the modified-file list. However, the diff also appears to introduce/expand Moment Tensor-related UI/logic that was not requested by REQ-32.",
