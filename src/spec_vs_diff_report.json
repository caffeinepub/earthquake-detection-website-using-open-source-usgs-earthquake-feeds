  "summary": "The diff addresses the reported modal-over-Leaflet layering issue by explicitly raising the Radix Dialog overlay/content z-index in the consumer component and by adding global Leaflet z-index normalization rules in app-level CSS, without modifying any files under frontend/src/components/ui. No clear gaps against REQ-13/REQ-14 are evident from the provided diff summary, but some Leaflet popup behavior was also changed (autoPan disabled), which was not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Changed Leaflet marker popup behavior by disabling popup autoPan (\"autoPan: false\"), which alters map behavior and was not requested as part of the z-index/modal layering fix.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on dialog/modal layering above Leaflet and preventing map interaction through the overlay; it explicitly lists non-goals around adding/changing data behavior and does not request popup behavior changes.",
