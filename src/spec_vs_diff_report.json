REQ-2 shows partial implementation evidence (fullscreen state + CSS for fullscreen overlay and a custom Leaflet fullscreen control style), but the diff summary is truncated and does not provide clear evidence that the control is inserted directly below Leaflet zoom controls with accessible text.",

      "requirement": "Add a Leaflet full-screen toggle button to the map UI positioned directly below the existing zoom in/out controls, with accessible text (e.g., aria-label/sr-only) such as \"Toggle full screen\".",
      "reason": "While fullscreen-related state and CSS exist, the provided (truncated) EarthquakeMapView diff does not show the Leaflet control being created/added beneath the zoom controls, nor any aria-label/sr-only accessible text for the control.",

      "requirement": "Fullscreen behavior must work in both Map View and Split View without breaking marker rendering or map interactions, and exiting fullscreen restores normal page scrolling/interaction.",
      "reason": "The diff shows body overflow toggling and map.invalidateSize(), but does not include enough visible code to confirm integration across view modes (Map vs Split) or confirm the control is present/functional in both contexts.",
